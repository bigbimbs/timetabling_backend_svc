# Timetabling Software (Backend Service)
Creating timetables for academic institutions involves venue allocation, workforce scheduling, course organization, and examination planning, posing a challenging task due to numerous constraints. These constraints can be 'hard' (essential) or 'soft' (desirable). This research showcases the effectiveness of genetic algorithms for optimal timetable planning, considering various academic institution constraints. The study develops models to address real-life scheduling intricacies and applies genetic algorithms to derive conflict-free timetables for courses, venues, departments, and lecturers. The results demonstrate the superiority of genetic algorithms over traditional methods in handling complex timetabling problems with multiple constraints. This research offers practical and efficient solutions for academic institution scheduling, optimizing resource utilization, managing lecturer workload, and improving stakeholder satisfaction. The successful implementation of genetic algorithms in this study marks a significant advancement in timetable optimization, with potential applications in educational institutions worldwide.
